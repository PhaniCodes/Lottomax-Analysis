# LottoMax Randomness & Pattern Analysis

## Overview
This project evis to evaluate whether  **Lotto Max** draws are statistically indistinguishable from a uniform random process and explores empirical frequencies (single balls, pairs, triplets).

## Project Goals
1. **Randomness Testing** - Verify if LottoMax numbers are truly random
2. **Pattern Analysis** - Find frequently occurring numbers, pairs, and triplets
3. **Machine Learning** - Attempt to predict patterns using ML techniques
4. **Data Management** - Easy system to add new draw results

## Contents
- `data/raw/` – Original Excel file with historical draws
- `data/processed/` – Cleaned CSV files for analysis
- `src/` – Python modules and utilities
- `scripts/` – Utility scripts for data processing
- `tests/` – Unit tests for statistical functions
-  `requirements.txt` – Dependencies

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+

### Installation
1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
